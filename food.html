            <p class="name">ROTI PRATA</p>
            <img src="img/food5.jpeg" alt="Food 5">
            <p>In Singapore, roti prata, a famous Indian flatbread, has become a mainstay for breakfast and snacks. Before cooking on a heated griddle, a dough mixture is stretched and turned into thin layers. Sweet condensed milk or a savory curry dipping sauce are common accompaniments to roti prata. This meal is a lovely treat because of the flaky and crispy texture of the bread, together with the fragrant curry and sweetness from the milk.</p>
